# Assembly Language Encryption

This project provides a simple example of encryption and decryption routines implemented in assembly language. It demonstrates a basic encryption algorithm and is intended for educational purposes.

## Features

- Encryption and decryption routines written in assembly language.
- Basic example of a symmetric encryption algorithm.
- Easy-to-understand code, suitable for educational purposes.

### Prerequisites

To run this code, you'll need:

- An x86-compatible processor (Intel or AMD) to execute the assembly code.
- An assembler and linker (e.g., NASM and LD) to assemble and link the code.

### Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/assembly-encryption.git
